    Description
    -----------
    The Auditor Log is a human-readable format that provides the information an auditor wants to
    know about the run of an application.  The format of the log is as follows:

        Application: MyApplication
        Version:     Version 1.0
        Date/Time:   03Jan2020 17:38:13
        Hostname:    apple_py_auditor-log-latest-20200103-162947-879186625

    This log contains the following information:
        Application: the name of the application.
        Version: the version number of the application.
        Date/Time: the time that the application was run.
        User ID: the user ID of the person who ran the application.
        Hostname: the system on which the application was run. 
        Invocation: the invocation for the application, showing all command line arguments.
        Results: describes the result of the operation
        Inputs: a list of the inputs for this run. Each file that is read is listed.
        Outputs: a list of the outputs for this run. Each output file is listed.


    This log is distinct from an application log file, which contains the detailed information recorded
    during the running of the application. That log is used for troubleshooting.
